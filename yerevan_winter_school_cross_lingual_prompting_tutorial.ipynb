    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Understanding the Landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "**The prompt engineering revolution** has transformed how we interact with language models. Instead of fine-tuning models for each task, we now craft instructions that guide pretrained models to solve problems through natural language interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Model Families Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Model Family** | **Strengths** | **Multilingual Support** | **Best For** |\n",
    "|------------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **🤖 GPT Family** | Creative, conversational | Limited (English-centric) | Creative writing, coding |\n",
    "| **🌍 Claude Family** | Helpful, harmless, honest | Growing multilingual | Analysis, reasoning |\n",
    "| **📚 T5/mT5 Family** | Text-to-text, multilingual | Excellent (mT5) | Structured tasks, low-resource languages |\n",
    "| **🔄 LLaMA/Mistral** | Open source, efficient | Varies by model | Research, customization |\n",
    "| **🌐 PaLM/Gemini** | Multimodal, reasoning | Strong multilingual | Complex reasoning tasks |\n",

    "**Success Strategies:**\n",
    "- Use multilingual models (mT5, XLM-R based systems)\n",
    "- Provide examples in your target language (few-shot learning)\n",
    "- Be explicit about cultural context\n",
    "- Test with native speakers\n",

    "## 2. 🚀 Quick Start: Model Access Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose your approach based on your resources and requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option A: 📡 API Access (Recommended for Production)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example API setup (uncomment and configure)\n",
    "# import openai\n",
    "# openai.api_key = \"your-api-key\"  # Never commit API keys!\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage function\n",
    "def call_api_model(prompt, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", max_tokens=150):\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"Call API model - replace with your preferred API\\\"\\\"\\\"\n",
    "    # return openai.Completion.create(model=model, prompt=prompt, max_tokens=max_tokens)\n",
    "    return \"[API call would happen here - paste actual response]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"📡 API Access: Great for latest models, requires internet + API key\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: 🏠 Local Models (For Privacy/Research)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example local model setup (uncomment if you have GPU)\n",
    "# from transformers import pipeline\n",
    "# generator = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"microsoft/DialoGPT-medium\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def call_local_model(prompt, max_length=150):\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"Call local model - uncomment if you have local setup\\\"\\\"\\\"\n",
    "    # return generator(prompt, max_length=max_length)\n",
    "    return \"[Local model would run here - paste actual response]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"🏠 Local Models: Great for privacy, requires GPU setup\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option C: ☁️ Web Interfaces (For Learning)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def call_web_interface(prompt):\n",
    "    \\\"\\\"\\\"Use ChatGPT, Claude, Poe, etc. - manual copy/paste\\\"\\\"\\\"\n",
    "    print(f\"📋 Copy this prompt to your web interface:\")\n",
    "    print(\"-\" * 50)\n",
    "    print(prompt)\n",
    "    print(\"-\" * 50)\n",
    "    return \"[Paste the response from your web interface here]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"☁️ Web Interfaces: Easy to start, good for experiments\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 For this tutorial:** We'll design prompts systematically and test them using your preferred method above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 🎯 Strategic Task and Language Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Why Strategic Selection Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Task Selection Strategy:**\n",
    "- **Start Simple:** Classification/QA before complex reasoning\n",
    "- **Real Impact:** Choose tasks relevant to your community's needs  \n",
    "- **Measurable:** Pick tasks with clear success criteria\n",
    "- **Testable:** Ensure you can evaluate results objectively\n",
    "\n",
    "**🌍 Language Selection Strategy:**\n",
    "- **Always Include English:** Baseline for comparison\n",
    "- **Choose Meaningfully:** Pick languages you can evaluate properly\n",
    "- **Consider Resources:** How much training data exists?\n",
    "- **Think Culturally:** Are there cultural nuances to test?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Recommended Task Types for Cross-Lingual Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Task Type** | **Complexity** | **Cultural Sensitivity** | **Evaluation** | **Good For** |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **📊 Classification** | Low | Medium | Clear metrics | Beginners, systematic testing |\n",
    "| **❓ Factual QA** | Medium | Low | Objective answers | Knowledge transfer testing |\n",
    "| **🔍 Sentiment Analysis** | Medium | High | Cultural context matters | Cross-cultural analysis |\n",
    "| **📝 Summarization** | High | Medium | Subjective evaluation | Advanced prompting |\n",
    "| **🔄 Translation Quality** | High | High | Native speaker needed | Language pair analysis |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Configure Your Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with:\n",
    "- **At least one task type** (start with classification or factual QA)\n",
    "- **English** (always include for baseline comparison)  \n",
    "- **At least one low-resource language** (Armenian, Luxembourgish, Kurdish, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Pro tip:** Pick languages where you can judge output quality or have native speaker access.\n"
