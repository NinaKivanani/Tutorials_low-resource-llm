    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you'll have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔧 A Working Environment** - All tools installed and tested (15 min)\n",
    "2. **🗺️ A Clear Roadmap** - Understanding of what's coming in Sessions 1-4 (5 min)\n",
    "3. **🌍 Your Language Focus** - A chosen low-resource language and test dataset (10 min)\n",
    "4. **📝 An Evaluation Toolkit** - Your personal assessment framework (10 min)\n",

    "## 🌟 Why This Course Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a sobering fact:** Most AI research focuses on just ~100 languages, leaving **6,900+ languages** largely ignored. These aren't \"small\" or \"unimportant\" languages—they're spoken by millions of people with rich cultural traditions and modern needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your role:** You're learning to be a bridge-builder. After this course, you'll know how to:\n",
    "- Evaluate whether AI models work for *any* language, not just English\n",
    "- Adapt and improve models for languages with limited resources\n",
    "- Identify and address biases that harm minority language speakers\n",
    "- Build ethical, inclusive AI systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**This matters because:** Language is identity, culture, and community. When AI only works well for a few languages, we're creating a technological divide that reinforces inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💭 A Quick Note Before We Start\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're feeling nervous:** That's completely normal! Many participants come in thinking they need to be \"AI experts\" or \"fluent in programming.\" You don't. We'll explain every concept, every line of code, and every decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If something doesn't work:** That's actually valuable! In low-resource language work, things don't always work perfectly—and learning to troubleshoot is part of the skill. I'll help you through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Questions are welcome at every step. No question is \"too basic\"—if you're wondering about it, others probably are too!"
