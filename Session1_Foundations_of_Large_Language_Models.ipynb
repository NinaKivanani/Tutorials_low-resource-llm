        "\n",
        "**The Connection:** Tokenization → Embeddings → Similarity Scores\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a crucial concept that many people overlook! Here's how poor tokenization can ruin your similarity analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🧩 **The Process Chain:**\n",
        "```\n",
        "Raw Text → Tokenization → Token Embeddings → Sentence Embedding → Similarity Score\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**When tokenization goes wrong, everything downstream suffers!**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 📝 **Concrete Examples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example 1: Word Breaking**\n",
        "```\n",
        "English: \"carefully\" → [\"careful\", \"##ly\"] (good: preserves meaning)\n",
        "Low-resource: \"sorgfältig\" → [\"so\", \"##r\", \"##g\", \"##fä\", \"##lt\", \"##ig\"] (bad: loses word structure)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** The low-resource word gets broken into meaningless fragments. The model can't learn that \"sorgfältig\" = \"carefully\" because it never sees \"sorgfältig\" as a coherent unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example 2: Unknown Token Explosion**\n",
        "```\n",
        "English: \"doctor\" → [\"doctor\"] (1 token, well-known)\n",
        "Low-resource: \"Dokter\" → [\"[UNK]\"] (1 unknown token, no meaning)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** The model has no representation for \"[UNK]\", so it gets a generic \"unknown\" embedding that doesn't capture the medical concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example 3: Inconsistent Splitting**\n",
        "```\n",
        "Same concept, different tokenization:\n",
        "\"diagnosis\" → [\"diagnosis\"] \n",
        "\"Diagnos\" → [\"Dia\", \"##gno\", \"##s\"]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** Even though both mean \"diagnosis,\" they get completely different embeddings because the tokenizer treats them as unrelated token sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ⚡ **The Cascade Effect:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Bad tokenization** → Fragments or unknown tokens\n",
        "2. **Poor token embeddings** → Generic or meaningless vectors  \n",
        "3. **Bad sentence embeddings** → Average of poor-quality token vectors\n",
        "4. **Low similarity scores** → Model appears to \"not understand\" the language\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 🛡️ **How to Detect This:**\n",
        "- Look at tokenization output: many tiny fragments = problem\n",
        "- High number of [UNK] tokens = problem  \n",
        "- Same meaning, very different token patterns = problem\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 💡 **Solutions:**\n",
        "- Choose models trained specifically on your target language\n",
        "- Use SentencePiece-based models (better with unseen languages)\n",
        "- Consider domain-specific models if your text has specialized vocabulary\n",
        "- Fine-tune tokenizers on your target language data"
